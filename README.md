# 🌥️ Kiruthika’s AWS Learning Journey

**Goal:** Learn AWS from foundations → hands-on → mini-projects, and document it transparently.  
**Style:** Daily notes, a small task, and a short quiz reflection.

- 🔁 I’ve previously implemented **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions) in my AI Sentinel project; I’ll keep applying similar rigor here.
- 🧠 Every day = learn → do → document → share.
- 🔗 Daily LinkedIn updates will reference this repo.

## 📅 Plan (living syllabus)

- Day 1: Cloud basics (on-prem vs cloud, service & deployment models) + cost simulation task
- Day 2: Create AWS account safely, IAM users, MFA, billing alarms
- Day 3: EC2 fundamentals (AMI, instance types, key pairs, security groups)
- Day 4: S3 buckets, storage classes, lifecycle rules, static website hosting
- Day 5: VPC basics (subnets, route tables, IGW, NAT)
- Day 6+: Hands-on mini projects (EC2 + S3; static website; simple serverless with Lambda, API Gateway; etc.)

> I’m self-learning first; certifications can come later.

## 🧩 How to run the Python tasks

Most tasks are pure Python.  
- On phone: open **Google Colab** (https://colab.research.google.com), create a new notebook, copy the code, run.  
- On laptop: `python file.py`
